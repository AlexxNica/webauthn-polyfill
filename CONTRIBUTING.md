# Using Pull Requests
If you want to contribute to the repo, please use a GitHub pull request. There are just a couple things to keep in mind:
- Make sure there is an issue open for your PR. If there isn't you can create one!
- The commit message should reference the issue and hopefully fix it (you can use "fixes #issueNumber" or "ref #issueNumber" if it doesn't fix it completely). 
- If you are modifying code, please add a description of what you did. If you are adding or modifying a feature add the links to the documentation to verify your changes are valid.
- Separate PR for separate issues. If you are updating several feature please do a PR for each one.

 Thank you for contributing!
